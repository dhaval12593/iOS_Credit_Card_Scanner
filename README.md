# iOS Credit Card Scanner
A utility built on Vision framework for scanning Credit Card and returning useful information

This was built as a part of hackathon at Expedia over a period of 2 days. 

The code was built as a separate framework as can be re-used as an SPM package(that's what we did to integrate it in our app) or Carthage or anyother dependency manager you like :) 

It also has a demo app which lets you see what the library does :)
